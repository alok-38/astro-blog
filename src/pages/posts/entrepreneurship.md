# Pragmatic view of entrepreneurship

While the media often glorifies startups aiming to "change the world" with disruptive innovations, the reality is that a large portion of entrepreneurs build wealth by:

- Solving everyday problems rather than chasing moonshots.

- Starting small and local, then growing based on demand.

- Using proven business models, such as service-based businesses, franchising, or e-commerce.

- Focusing on profitability early, rather than growth at all costs.

This approach reduces risk and increases the chances of building a sustainable, profitable business. Think of local service businesses, online product resellers, or even niche consultancies—these don’t aim to be the next Uber but can generate excellent income and personal freedom.
