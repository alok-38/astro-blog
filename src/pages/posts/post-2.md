Acquiring the right skill set is the foundation of becoming a successful freelance web developer.

# Core Skills

No matter which path you take, these three skills are non-negotiable:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

## Why

These three are non-negotiable because they form the foundation of the web. Every website, no matter how simple or complex, relies on them.

### ðŸ”§ Platforms vs. Core Skills

| Platforms                        | HTML/CSS/JavaScript           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Fast for simple websites         | Essential for custom websites |
| Great for non-developers         | Gives full creative control   |
| Limited flexibility              | Infinite flexibility          |
| Youâ€™re bound by the toolâ€™s rules | You create your own rules     |
