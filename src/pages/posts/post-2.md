# How to Become a Freelance Web Developer

Acquiring the right skill set is the foundation of becoming a successful freelance web developer.

## Core Skills

No matter which path you take, these three skills are non-negotiable:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

## Why These Skills Matter

Theyâ€™re essential because they let you go beyond templates and truly **understand how the web works**. They give you the ability to build custom solutions, fix problems, and bring any design to life.
