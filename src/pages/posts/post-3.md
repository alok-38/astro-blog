# When it comes to freelancing, who is a basic web developer?

Freelancing in web development can be an exciting way to earn while you learn. In this post, we'll explore who a basic web developer is and how you can become one—even if you're just starting out.

In freelancing, a **basic web developer** is someone who typically handles **foundational aspects** of building websites. They focus on creating static or simple dynamic websites using core web technologies. Here's what that usually includes:

## 💻 Skills of a Basic Web Developer:

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page (headings, paragraphs, links, etc.).

- **CSS**: Styling the layout, fonts, colors, and responsiveness.

- **JavaScript (basic)**: Simple interactivity like dropdowns, form validation, or image sliders.

- **Basic SEO and Accessibility**: Making sites readable by search engines and usable for everyone.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the site works well on phones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Version Control (sometimes)**: Basic Git usage for tracking changes.

## 🛠️ What They Typically Do:

- Build personal portfolios, blogs, or brochure-style business websites.

- Work with templates or page builders like WordPress (without deep customization).

- Make updates to existing sites (e.g., change content, update styling).

- Convert design files (like Figma or PSDs) into code.

They're kind of the **"entry-level" developers**—often the first step into web development. As they grow, they might move into frontend frameworks (like React) or backend work (like handling databases or APIs).
